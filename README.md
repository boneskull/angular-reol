angular-reol [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/decipherinc/angular-reol.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/decipherinc/angular-reol)
============

Reol.js (https://npmjs.org/package/reol) forked to AngularJS factory.  I have run this code a little bit.  Use at your own risk.

Warning: This code was forked against an older version of Reol.js!  While it has most of the same functionality it likely has bugs that have since been fixed elsewhere.   

## Installation

```
bower install angular-reol
````

## Build

```
npm install
grunt
```

## Run Tests
```
npm install
grunt test
```
